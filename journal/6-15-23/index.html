	<p>Legal pads, right, they’re flat and yellow. They are nice to write
	on—a pencil glides smoothly, a pen’s ink contrasts with the paper
	pleasingly; they are comfortable on your lap, perforated, and have
	bulbous margins for notes. Neat! So why the <em>fuck</em> can’t I use
	the back side of a page? Look:</p>

	<p>What am I supposed to do with this? Multiple lines <em>unusable</em>
	due to the binding, and you lose more and more as you go through the
	booklet. Yet another example of lousy manufacturing, with no love
	towards the consumer or the planet. It seems we’re only meatbags with wallets,
	or space-rocks with minerals. Damn
	American capitalist piggies, sizzle on Satan’s skillet!</p>
	<p>Hardcover books, right, dust covers are annoying. They slide off as
	you are holding the book in the air, which you are forced to do, since
	the book snaps shut otherwise. French flaps achieve the same thing as a
	dust cover, with internal space for author biographies and such, and
	don’t fall off. France has the right ideas, unlike American bacon.
	Poignant.</p>
	<p>Where are the trees going? To legal pads and dust covers. Provide
	your paper with pristine purpose; please, don’t pollute, pain, or
	pervert our parental, paternal planet. Poignant.</p>
