		<p>In the 98 days between now and the last post, school has started, as
		well as autumn. On average I have been tired. Fall is my downfall.</p>
		<p>It’s provocative: fall is the prettiest season but the most
		aggressive against my body. Allergies become death, and all moisture and
		warmth escapes while battling the dry air.</p>
		<p>I write this in the fleeting moments of a three-day weekend (on a
		holiday that should not be celebrated)—typical, I always receive a boost
		of creative energy when I have the least time to use it. This morning I
		woke up at approximately 8:30 but did not get out of bed for two hours.
		The intermediate timespan was spent in catnap limbo. I believe that I
		fantasized so intricately that I thought they were dreams; I don’t
		remember any imagery, however, so I don’t think I dreamt at all.</p>
		<p>I like to make things. I think it’s the most important thing in life,
		to make things.</p>
		<p>Alas, autumn approaches! And I am stuck with half of my nose
		blocked at any given time. Buzzy sleepiness in the day and torturous
		energy at night. How can I fully Make?</p>
		<p>In the daily bursts of untimely energy I follow any inspiration that
		manifests itself. It is like the catnap limbo—vivid fantasies in flux.
		Between games, programs, writing, drawing, music, any of the many
		mediums, there are lots of ideas and buds of projects, all of which lack
		a common thread I could tie into a final, polished product.</p>
		<p>I don’t have any solutions, but I do have fun.</p>
		<p>Next fall is my final one as a minor, which is sad but c’est la vie.
		I try, you know?</p>
