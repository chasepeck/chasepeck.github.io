		<p>A real clustercuss my social abilities are—a real hubbub, plight,
		truly a katzenjammer—and so common is the social sickness to my stomach,
		I could graph it.</p>
		<figure><img src="socialscale.jpg"></figure>
		<h2>Comfortable</h2>
		<p>No symptoms. Most common with direct family and close, <em>close</em>
		friends.</p>
		<p><em>EX:</em> Talking with your parents at dinner, talking with your
		friend whom was born in the same delivery room, moaning with your
		significant other during intercourse</p>
		<h2>Confused</h2>
		<p>A slight bewilderment at being suddenly approached, not hearing what
		was said, or failing to comprehend what the asparagus is going on, for
		example.</p>
		<p><em>EX:</em> A stranger asks where the bathroom is (you don’t know),
		a stranger asks where the bathroom is while the neighboring house is
		being renovated (you don’t hear), a stranger mumbles something to you
		about satellites and telepathy (you don’t understand)</p>
		<h2>Colored Cheeks</h2>
		<p>Cheeks become warm and rufescent. Usually a result of being asked to
		introduce yourself, maybe in one of those wretched icebreaker games at
		school, or another person bringing up your accomplishments and personal
		traits.</p>
		<p><em>EX:</em> It is your turn to say your full name, three fun facts
		about yourself, and your favorite animal; your mother introduces you to
		the other adults as shy, he’s our little programmer; an acquaintance
		asks what your hobbies are</p>
		<h2>Crying</h2>
		<p>Face moistens. From the tone of their voice, I can tell they are
		annoyed, or disappointed, or both. Do they know what I thought was a
		secret?</p>
		<p><em>EX:</em> “Bud, you’re on the presentation team—you need to say
		something once in a while,” “Wow, that’s a lot of corn starch on the
		floor,” “Do you have crushes on boys or girls?”</p>
		<h2>Cardiorespiratory Complications</h2>
		<p>Drastically increased BPM, hyperventilation. Consequently includes
		nausea, vomiting, profuse sweating, dizziness, blurry vision, tinnitus.
		They are angry, I am incompetent, everyone is looking.</p>
		<p><em>EX:</em> Woefully inept in the presentation team, I bungle
		everything, including the setup for the Rube Goldberg machine; I reread
		the letter to my teacher in my head; what is the formula?</p>
		<h2>Comatose</h2>
		<p>Stay hopeful, you’ll be dead soon.</p>
		<p><em>EX:</em> “What are you watching? Is he naked?” “Whose fox tail is
		this? And the ears?” “I love you.”</p>

	I am here to say, keep going. If you are affected by the same conditions
	as me (autism, anxiety, adolescence), I connect, we’re all trying our
	best. For some, the world makes perfect sense. To us, it’s batshit
	fucking explosion quantum physics bastard wild katzenjammer. We each see
	our own unique version of the world, and we should cherish that.
