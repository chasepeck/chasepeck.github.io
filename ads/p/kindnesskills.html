    <h1>PSA FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</h1>
    </i>
    <p>
        Alert. This is the president. We would like to notify you of a national security threat. Kindness. Kindness is deadly. We would like
        to ask all citizens of the United States to cease being kind. Kindness can cause heart attacks, seizures, blood clots, projectile vomiting, complete memory loss,
        type two diabetes, severe allergic reactions, swelling, muscle atrophy, organ death, kidney explosions, blindness, spine breaking, and spontaneous combustion.
        Please do not be kind as it can spread and kill quickly!
    </p>
