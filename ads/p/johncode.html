<h1><i>And now, an interview with John Code.</i></h1>
<pre style="font-size: 25px;">
INTERVIEWER: Now, John, how did you get the idea for code?

JOHN: Uh, well, one day I was doing math for fun, and I decided "hey,
math is actually kind of boring. I need something to do it for me."
That's when I realized I could use a computer (they couldn't do math yet)
to do math! But I needed some way to tell the computer to do math. I started
by yelling at the computer, but it got scared and ran away. I then cradled the
computer and told it "hey, big C, can you do some math for me?" and that offended
the computer, because the computer didn't want to be treated like a baby. But then,
I wrote "Do math!" on a piece of paper and showed it to the computer.
But then it said "SyntaxError: invalid syntax" which made absolutely no sense.

INTERVIEWER: So how did you come up with the idea for code, then?

JOHN: What? Oh, I don't know. It just... I don't know. It just kinda happened.
Not really sure. Think I dreamt it. Yeah.

INTERVIEWER: Okayyy, well that's all we have time for today!
