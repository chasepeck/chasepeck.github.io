			<p>
	The Empress is not as godly as
Her predecessors. Modern democracy has surrendered the powers of Her
position to the Grand Legislative Hall on the bottom floor of the
Palace. So, since adolescence, She has been content in Her bedroom of
quadrants. Her shelves of novels and nonfiction suffocate the western
wall. To the east, reams of Her poetry sit underneath Her writing
desk. Two frameless beds, made to Her exact proportions, lie flat and
unassuming to the south. The simplicity is lit by the northern
window, translucent, perpetually shining mauve from the courtyard’s
ultraviolet light poles.</p>
<p>
	The courtyard, circumscribed by
the rectangular Palace, is punctuated with stones, amongst which an
artificial stream weaves. Berries, maroon, grow on its banks, swaying
like tails in the current. Three trees, rooted equidistant from each
other, reach their shivering heads past the roof of the Palace,
counterbalancing the potpourri of chrysanthemums, primroses, irises,
and wisterias below. The light poles stand overbearingly above the
arbor and douse the land with purple to feed its photosynthesis. The
water diverges in the center, the western branch circling into an
ergonomic pool fashioned with warm jets and aesthetical LEDs.</p>
<p>
	The Empress suds Herself with a
bar of soap gifted by Her girlfriends in the Court of Artisans. The
warm jets by Her lower legs, and each ephemeral bubble on the water’s
surface, gently buoy Her. She begins to drift into the dawning
overcast, but Her gaze is diverted to a man through the middle floor
window, doing nothing but gazing back. His face seems cut in half
from this distance. He wears a black robe adorned with green spirals,
fastened with a red band at the waist. In spontaneous anger the
Empress fetches one of the pebbles that line the pool and whips it in
the man’s direction. It misses—on the foliage, a dense thud—but
the man still retreats.</p>
<p>
	Neatly laid upon two planar
stones are the Empress’s towel and robe. The Empress ascends from
the bath, dries and dresses Herself. She savors the freshly dry
feeling, inhaling a stab of the greenery’s fresh air. The slab of
cloud is a fair gray now. She wonders how Earth would feel if it had
no ceiling. Beyond those clouds is blue infinity, apparently, as She
has seen in pictures.</p>
<p>
	She sighs, reenters the Palace,
climbs two flights of the western staircase, passes the Court of
Artisans, enters Her bedroom—where Asahi pounces on the Empress.</p>
<p>
	“Woah, dear! Are you hungry?”</p>
<p>
	Asahi relinquishes, whimpers. He
skids around, throws Himself down onto the center of the room.</p>
<p>
	The Empress darts toward Him and
falls to Her knees. “Asahi!”</p>
<p>
	She stares. The Golden Pup’s
eyes glow a deeper form of gold. The Pup’s fur glows a more
aggressive form of gold. A cirrus of flame manifests above Him; it
swirls like the courtyard pool, swirls into a drain and feeds itself,
blinding, and The Sun emerges to say—</p>
<p style="color: #c9211e;">
	Empress.</p>
<p>
	The Empress, silent.</p>
<p style="color: #c9211e;">
	Empress, I
Am The Sun. My Energy Depletes. Much Time And No Success With The
Animals Beyond The City Limits. But Asahi Inherits The Light Of Your
Divine Heritage. He May Not Survive As I Depart. I Am Deeply Sorry. I
Could Not Delay Any Further.</p>
<p>
	The Empress…silent.</p>
<p style="color: #c9211e;">
	I Ask Of
You A Monumental Task, But Otherwise Humanity Shall Be Starved. I
Have Toiled In Pain For Many Months. The Clouds Impede My Stream Of
Energy, The Spirit Of Life. I Fear—I Fear There Is But A Day
Remaining. Twenty-Four Hours Until I Burn Out. The Clouds May Not
Glow Tomorrow.</p>
<p>
	The Empress—silent.</p>
<p style="color: #c9211e;">
	Empress,
You Have Twenty-Four Hours To Stop The Clock. Part The Clouds. I Love
You, Empress, My Descendant. I Fatigue Quickly. Goodbye.</p>
<p>
	The Empress, silent, blinks—the
bedroom as normal, worldly Asahi on the floor. His eyes are closed.</p>
<p>
	The Empress shoves the affairs
of Her top drawer into Her robe pockets. She sprints out, down the
hallway, past the Court of Artisans, down two flights of the western
staircase, past the Court of Accountants, enters the commons. Tears
wet Her neck.</p>
<p>
	Legislators chat, speckled about
the cushioned round booths, underneath dozens of lanterns tethered to
the skylight. The skylight is not much more than a solid color. The
entrance to the Grand Legislative Hall looms on the right, vomiting
yet more lawmakers, all wearing the robe of the profession: black,
adorned with green spirals, fastened with a red band at the waist.</p>
<p>
	Heads turn one by one. The
Empress stands panting between the Hall and the kitchen.</p>
<p>
	A Legislator approaches briskly
from across the commons. Shadows live underneath His eyes. His dark
beard ends at a perfectly horizontal line on His face, as if groomed
with a ruler.</p>
<p>
	“What are you doing?” He
says to the Empress. “You have nothing scheduled today. And your
face is all wet.”</p>
<p>
	“Uncle, I have to go.”</p>
<p>
	“Where? You’re not fiddling
around with someone, are you?”</p>
<p>
	“No—no, it’s urgent, I—”</p>
<p>
	“Come on, go back to your—”</p>
<p>
	The Empress dashes past Her
Uncle, towards the front gate. Uncle yells. Thankfully nearly all of
the Legislators are post-sixty and cannot run as passionately as the
youthful Empress. Behind Her, the squealing of chairs, heavy
stumbling of shoes, and frustrated grumblings of old men are heard.
The Empress shoulders the tall glass doors.</p>
<p>
	The Palace overlooks the
cityscape, chromatic and endlessly buzzing; on its closest edge, the
singular river hugs tightly, dashed with railways and bridges. The
path of wooden arches and pikes of illumination stretches down the
Palace’s hill, on which the UV komorebi shimmers through the puffy
trees and bushes. The Empress subverts the path, sneaks through one
of the arches. Heading east, She follows the footpaths made by the
gardeners.</p>
<p>
	Ahead, the transit line departs
every half-hour. The station stretches from the eastern rear of the
Palace to the farthest governmental tree.</p>
<p>
	The Empress passes a pavilion,
containing equipment and freshly watered pots of bamboo. She quickly
sweeps two fingers on wet dirt and applies it around Her eyes as
makeup.</p>
<p>
	The leaves tickle Her cheeks.</p>
<p>
	There is no liminality between
the Palace garden and the train station. The Empress mounts two feet
of concrete to behold the expanse of the platform, and the side of a
dumpster. The aesthetics of the city seep towards the Palace through
the station, with its pure geometry and vivid colors. Clumps of
government workers wait for the bullet, which, as the flatscreens
announce, arrives in five minutes. The Empress feels the plastic
transit pass in Her robe pocket.</p>
<p>
	She chooses a group of women and
vaguely blends with them; She turns Her head elsewhere. Eventually,
in from the city, the train whirrs to an electrical stop. A fresh
coat of glossy white paint, its mouse head dons a pair of shades.
Vomiting yet more lawmakers.</p>
<p>
	Taking Her seat, the Empress
regards the improvised makeup in the reflection of the window. She
passes unrecognized. Passengers sleep, watch the touchscreens, or
fiddle through their briefcases. Destined for only two destinations,
the train chimes. The Palace’s front yard slips away below the
elevated rail.</p>
<p>
	The Empress sweats under Her
arms. The overcast seems dimmer than usual.</p>
<p>
	“The first Emperor to never
see The Sun,” Her Father had mumbled as He died.</p>
<p>
	It is only five minutes to the
city. The menagerie of buildings blurs past like a flock of
aggravated birds—a flock of tall, modern monuments to cash, each
hosting its own multicolored array of windows.</p>
<p>
	The bullet halts, lets off at
the lip of the city, a park that sits on the riverbank. The Empress
looks back to the Palace, leering from its hill, orbited by angelic,
purple stars.</p>
<p>
	But the Empress wastes no more
time. She starts to walk west, on the perimeter of the city. There
are mostly shops on this outer edge, and of the shops there are
mostly tanning salons.</p>
<p>
	She walks for thirty minutes
when the buildings switch from transparent to opaque. The skyscrapers
descrape the sky, lay horizontal now. Vines of pipes tangle their
sides. The natural static of human affairs gives way to an
unrelenting metallic rhythm. The UV light is ever harsher,
incessantly reflected by a fog that slowly creeps this way, streaked
with shadows of the sky-reaching tubes that groan from the lifeless
buildings.</p>
<p>
	Birds cram themselves onto every
inch of the power lines that pendulate between industry on both sides
of the streets. The Empress follows where the wires lead. As She
walks underneath, all of the birds fly away at once.</p>
<p>
	The wires, after tying
themselves together, converge on a sizable steel box, where the road
dies.</p>
<p>
	The Empress fetches from Her
left pocket a small metal contraption, with a place to rest Her
pointer finger. She points its long end at the box. After a grip of
Her finger, the box explodes.</p>
<p>
	Immediately, all color vanishes
from the fog. Hot sparks pour from what is left of the box. The
Empress—silent—drops Her device where She stands.</p>
<p>
	Behind the flames, a chain-link
fence was blown awry. The Empress counts two seconds between
eruptions of sparks. With a running start, two seconds, She leaps
over the rubble. The steel mill greets Her, and She responds with no
pause.</p>
<p>
	The Empress sweats even more,
further than under Her arms. Her body trembles violently. She walks
with Her eyes closed, repeating phrases, to convince Herself this was
necessary.</p>
<p>
	Workers are streaming out of the
doors. The Empress hastily finds a set of scaffolding to perch
Herself. In no time, workers fill the mill’s yard.</p>
<p>
	“Listen!”</p>
<p>
	Some workers perk up.</p>
<p>
	She yells, “Listen! I am your
Empress!”</p>
<p>
	The workers stare at Her,
confused.</p>
<p>
	“Who?” one responds.</p>
<p>
	“Everyone, please listen! The
Empress will explain this!”</p>
<p>
	“Since when did we have an
Empress?” She can hear some mumble.</p>
<p>
	“Must be insane.”</p>
<p>
	“She shot the box! There’s
soot all over Her!”</p>
<p>
	“Terrorist!”</p>
<p>
	She pleads, “No—no! You have
it wrong! Please listen—The Sun has spoken to me—”</p>
<p>
	The scaffolding rumbles,
resonates up Her knees.</p>
<p>
	Three men reach the top.</p>
<p>
	“Wait!”</p>
<p>
	The Empress is tackled. She hits
Her head on the railing. She falls asleep.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The Empress wakes up, handcuffed
to a chair, behind a podium. Every eye of the Grand Legislative Hall
gazes at Her.</p>
<p>
	Her Uncle approaches the stand.</p>
<p>
	She starts before He can speak:
“Uncle! The Sun spoke to me! She said the clouds would kill Her. I
did what I had to, if you don’t want to live in darkness—”</p>
<p>
	“One second. You are being
tried—”</p>
<p>
	“Skip that!”</p>
<p>
	Uncle glares at the Empress.
“The Sun? The Sun spoke to you?”</p>
<p>
	“Yes!”</p>
<p>
	“How?”</p>
<p>
	A knife forms in the Empress’s
throat. “She—She embodied Asahi.”</p>
<p>
	“We saw that He did not
survive.”</p>
<p>
	The Empress, silent.</p>
<p>
	“Why did you kill Him?” asks
Uncle.</p>
<p>
	“What?! Are you crazy—”</p>
<p>
	“I <i>always</i> knew you were
ready to screw up the natural order of things!” Uncle yells. “You
always refused to come to the Hall’s parties, locked yourself in
your cell, never tried for any political power. And now you’ve been
a loner for so long that you’ve gone insane! You take your heritage
for granted. You rot. You write <i>poetry.</i>”</p>
<p>
	“Why do you think I am insane?
Taking my heritage for granted? We are descended from The Sun! She
has spoken!”</p>
<p>
	“There is no place in society
for supernatural malarkey anymore! You can’t expect everything to
go your way because, supposedly, you are descended of a goddess! If
you can’t accept that, we’ll send you to law school!”</p>
<p>
	The Empress still sweats.</p>
<p>
	“You’re an idiot!” She
screams. “I’m not your project, Uncle! Get your head out—”</p>
<p>
	Uncle punches the Empress.</p>
<p>
	The Hall, silent.</p>
<p>
	Uncle frantically turns His head
around, when the Empress’s body begins to glow.</p>
<p style="color: #c9211e;">
	Legislators.
I Am The Sun. The Empress Will Not Survive. I
Am Almost Dead. You Must Legislate A Solution In Two Hours.</p>

	Or Live
Without Me.</p>
