		<p>The <em>thing</em> groped me, with both of its hands, at the waist,
		and it lifted me over its head. It smiled widely, and I could see the
		chunks of blood stuck in its teeth. I looked into its disc-like eyes,
		black and reflective. Its skin was a metallic gray, with a hint of green.</p>
		<p>The teeth separated. It opened its mouth to devour me. I could do
		nothing but scream.</p>
		<p>I came to in the classroom’s closet, packed with storybooks at every
		wall, from floor to ceiling. I timidly opened the door, and then I saw
		my parents, sitting at the small plastic table at the other end of the
		room, waiting with my lunch. I rushed over to them.</p>
		<p>Wordlessly they handed me a box of Goldfish crackers. I began to
		chomp down, as <em>it</em> had once done to me. It was there. At the
		closet door that I had just traversed. But it was not looking at me;
		instead it was bent over slightly, looking ill.</p>
		<p>Suddenly a sonic boom. It flew with a great velocity, towards the
		back wall. The air around it distorted with the shock wave. I could not
		see it—the room was in an <em>L</em> shape—but I heard it crash, bring
		down the drywall. It had vomited.</p>
		<p>What a packed first year of preschool.</p>
		<p>Something bizarre brewed inside of me. It was a sensation that, as a
		preschooler, was completely foreign. We know it now to be physical
		attraction. I miss <em>it</em>.</p>

		I had this dream in preschool. It is still vivid. A theme of my prepubescent
		dreams is feeling romantic or physical attraction, but obviously being unaware
		of the true nature of it. One thing I’ve noticed about my dreams as a youngin, as seen here,
		is the correlation between morbidness and attraction. Well.
