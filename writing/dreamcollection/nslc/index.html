		<p>I enter the prodigious hangar through the gate. I display my passport
		to the gentleman—nervous, nervous he will catch me in my ruse. He does
		not. He gives a pleasant smile and gestures me towards the plane.</p>
		<p>But I have not escaped. There is a second attendant, a much older man
		with graying hair and drooping cheeks. He asks for my name, and I
		confidently tell him, “Chase Peck.”</p>
		<p>“Chasing what? Pecking?”</p>
		<p>“Chase Peck?” I repeat.</p>
		<p>“What are we chasing, a woodpecker? Ha! Chasing pecks?”</p>
		<p>“Sorry?”</p>
		<p>“Ha ha, yes. I know it’s a name. Anyway, I have some questions.”</p>
		<p>Zut. Keep calm.</p>
		<p>“You,” he begins, “are boarding this plane on a business trip?”</p>
		<p>“Yessir.”</p>
		<p>“And you work for the Nutritional School Lunches Corporation?”</p>
		<p>“Yessir.”</p>
		<p>“You are a lunch lady, correct?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
		<p>“What’s your business at the NSLC headquarters?”</p>
		<p>“Well, I’m advocating for better treatment of lunch ladies.”</p>
		<p>“Is that so?”</p>
		<p>“Yes.” Somehow, I am able to maintain a believable stream of lies.
		“Don’t you know how teenagers treat lunch ladies these days? Absolutely
		abhorrent.”</p>
		<p>We are standing in a lunch line, or a sort of buffet. The attendant
		stands on the opposite side.</p>
		<p>I say, “A teenager doesn’t care about the food. All he sees—I use
		<em>he</em> because of the tendency for violence in men—is the forearms
		of the lunch ladies, and of course he wants to punch them. The lunch
		ladies are abused, their forearms are punched. And thus they
		explode.”</p>
		<p>“They <em>explode?</em>”</p>
		<p>“Well, yes, they explode. There is way, way too much violence
		nowadays.”</p>
		<p>Other people are lined up next to and across from me at the buffet
		counter. I look down. There is a plate of chocolate chip cookies, and I
		take one.</p>
		<p>I notice my cousin. She has heard my conversation, and adds, “Yes,
		don’t you know how they make cookies? They use <em>milk.</em> From
		<em>cows.</em> If you think about it, we are stealing from the young
		calves. We steal the milk for ourselves, to make sugary treats.”</p>
		<p>“That’s right,” I say. “Don’t you know, mister? Every time you eat a
		cookie, a baby dies.”</p>
		<p>“No way,” the attendant says.</p>
		<p>“Yes way.” I take a bite of the cookie. “There goes one.”</p>
		<p>“Woah,” he breathes.</p>
		<p>I recall an event: I was riding in the passenger seat of my parents’
		car one day, down the road to the local park. There were cows; there are
		usually no cows. Now I think just how much milk I’ve stolen from them in
		my life. I become awash with guilt.</p>
		<p>I do not actually work at the Nutritional School Lunches
		Corporation.</p>
		<p>The elderly attendant gestures me onto the plane. I thank him.</p>
		<p>I remove my laptop and three hard disk drives from my bag. Without
		much hassle I plug in all of the drives with my myriad dongles and USB
		boxes. Finder loads the files, and a cheeky smirk escapes from me.</p>
		<p>Of course, the intergalactic novellas and manifestos—the literature
		of the Sidereal Alliance, a societal outcry over the injustice caused by
		the treacherous lunch ladies of Earth. My real job is to translate the
		works from the various Sidereal Languages, such as QiB4inopII,
		Keplerian, and RRng’snopgr. Finally, the Nutritional School Lunches
		Corporation will be taken down by the Sidereal Armed Forces, and the
		lunch ladies will suffer greatly for their crimes.</p>

		Often I do not write down every single detail of the dream, but I
		happen to remember them anyway.
		The original bullet points: Cafeteria lady company. Teenagers punching
		café ladies, exploding. Eating cookies; for each, a baby dies. Down
		the road to [local park], cows? Intergalactic languages on disk drives.
		Old man is interrogating me, doesn’t know the last name “Peck.”
