		<p>My mother parked; the lot was illuminated only by the tall electric
		lights, whose light shimmered on the moist, snowy ground. I stepped out
		of the car, into the frigidness, tired and heavily clothed. I bid
		farewell to my mother and younger brother, still in the vehicle. They
		waved back.</p>
		<p>The building was university-style, wide and formal. It hugged the
		parking lot on two sides. I walked towards the main entrance, double
		doors, tall and wooden. My boots struggled to find their footing.</p>
		<p>I slipped, flung my arms out, barely missed a car’s bumper. My head
		was protected, gratitude to my hood and beanie. Carefully I wrestled
		myself vertical, stepped forward with prudence.</p>
		<p>The doors were only one crossing away, when the piercing glare of a
		car manifested itself. The driver respectfully stopped. I was planning
		to walk forward, but instead I fell backward—yes, once more. Draped over
		me was a sweaty blanket of embarrassment. I was out of air. I assumed a
		kneeling position, began to push off against my legs, ended up pushing
		my legs into the asphalt, and I fell again.</p>
		<p>I was cocooned in self-consciousness. Supine on the wet concrete,
		bombarded by weighty snowflakes, I laughed. To confess my agony to the
		driver, to plead to him or her, “Please have empathy with me,” I
		laughed. And it would remain a mystery for the rest of my life whether
		they did or not.</p>
		<img id="sectionbreak" src="/assets/sectionbreaks/dinkus.jpg">
		<p>So I made it, finally. I opened the door, and was taken by
		surprise—dozens of men and women in black shirts, their backs towards
		me. Some held large cameras or boom mics. Lights highlighted the center
		of the rug-covered lounging room, where, stood in a circle, was a troupe
		of Japanese actors.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, the audio technician whipped around. He said, “Ah, there
		you are. We are about to shoot the next scene. Get in frame.”</p>
		<p>He ushered me to the acting group. I stood awkwardly, for I was not
		an actor. From behind I heard the director, I guess, yell, “Action!”</p>
		<p>The next moment, the group I had been inducted into was being
		violently shoved into the corner by the antagonists. Once we were
		properly confined to our spots, one of the kidnappers talked in
		Japanese. I understood him to be saying, “So! We have brought you here
		evilly to ask you this very, <em>very</em> important question! Are you
		ready?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, I’m ready. What’s so important about that?” said an actor in
		the corner.</p>
		<p>“No! That’s not the question. It’s this…In your opinion, what are the
		tenets of human existence? Starting with you,” the man said, pointing to
		the smooth-skinned actor next to me.</p>
		<p>“Well, gee…I think—I think—love, and kindness…” he said,
		sheepishly.</p>
		<p>“<em>Love?!</em> And <em>kindness?!</em> Bwaa-hahaha! Did you hear
		what he said?” the kidnapper cackled to his accomplices, “He thinks
		human existence is about <em>love and kindness!</em>” His buddies
		cackled too.</p>
		<p>I felt bad for the young actor, because I agreed. Though I forgot we
		were acting.</p>
		<p>The villain wiped tears from his cheeks and joyfully sighed. He
		looked at me. “What do you think?”</p>
		<p>Thus I woke up.</p>

		Perhaps it’s anticlimactic.
		The original bullet points: Slid across ice on road in headlights of oncoming traffic,
		supine. Traveling into a large building, university-style, mother and brother behind
		in car. Inside is a troupe of Japanese actors; as I enter the building without
		authorization I am confused for an actor and introduced into the film. The gang is
		kidnapped in the movie and asked what they think the tenets of human existence are.
		Somebody says something and is made fun of by the kidnappers; it was not a good answer,
		I guess.
