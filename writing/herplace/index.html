I met her in Quadrant III
For she is a double negative
A perplexing assault on grammar
Yet I’ve a strange desire to hear more

Now I cannot get rid of her
As if she is permanently affixed
To my central nervous system
I cannot tell if I mind

I fall asleep to the crumble of the rain
While she is only energized
Midnight, I am awoken by stomps and shouts
As she soliloquizes in the kitchen

Again she absorbs me into the liminal
Between reason and freedom
I chase her along the timeline
But she forever evades, running faster still

“Please slow down,” I plead
“How ’bout no?” she says
As she yoinks off
To another continuum

Enervated I fall to the ground
Through which I see all I’ve been missing
She stands there, on the grass
Beckoning!

“In this place you cannot worry about mortal things,”
She says, “you have to trust both of us—
We are complementary, and together we can
Just <i>create.</i>”

Returned to my room, the alarm screeches
Achy, no homework done
I wonder, am I a masochist or hedonist?
It doesn’t matter—I am happy.</pre>
