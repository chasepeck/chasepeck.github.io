	On my kitchen island<br>
	We’ve prepared a delectable feast<br>
	Any food you could imagine<br>
	A repast fit for a beast<br><br>

	Colorful grapes<br>
	In red, white, and blue<br>
	And I’m not totally sure<br>
	But I think that there might be some wine in
	the back, too<br><br>

	  On my kitchen island<br>
	  Your reflection can be seen<br>
	  Gaze at the refractions<br>
	  And the Pacific’s crystalline gleam<br><br>

	  It isn’t so hard<br>
	  To watch from afar<br>
	  Yet the Coast Guard gets in their feeble heads<br>
	  That this island’s not rightfully mine<br><br>

	  On my kitchen island<br>
	  The monkeys make the hors d’oeuvres<br>
	  And the sirloin steak<br>
	  Is cooked by the tropical birds<br><br>

	  And that’s just the start<br>
	  Course one out of five<br>
	  Over there’s the hippopotami<br>
	  Whipping up the chicken and fries<br><br>

	  We live a quiet life<br>
	  Unaffected by mortal strife<br>
	  There is no need for a wife<br>
	  When you make love to the wildlife<br><br>

	  One thing about which I could complain<br>
	  Is the tread on my domain<br>
	  By those who cause much disdain<br>
	  The gluttons for carnage, the bringers of pain,
	  the United States Internal Revenue Service<br><br>

	  Oh, my kitchen island<br>
	  Has been illegally seized<br>
	  They’re going to turn it for profit<br>
	  And murder all of the trees<br><br>

	  Oh, what an injustice<br>
	  And now I’m in hospice<br>
	  That’s why you don’t trust this<br>
	Criminal government, which controls all of our
	  guns and our press and our thoughts
