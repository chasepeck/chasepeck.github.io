		Wake up in the morning (do not, I mean)<br>
		No energy for much more, it seems<br>
		Than Nothing and Nothing and Nothing<br><br>

		Slog around, carry your fog around<br>
		Electric brain-fog, via wires underground<br>
		Zaps you into obsequiousness<br><br>

		Part ways with it, away's the brume<br>
		But greeting's the gregarious Moon<br>
		In lieu of the Sun is a warm lamp<br><br>

		The traffic held up by the opaque mist<br>
		Comes now to the cortex with its impetuous fist<br>
		And a pencil and paper's all you want<br><br>

		But the Moon, you knew it couldn't be trusted<br>
		Hypnotizes you with all the power it can muster<br>
		And Earth's gravity holds your eyelids<br><br>

		Only a handful of strokes has your hand spewed<br>
		But the financial report is nearly due<br>
		So one must succumb to biology.
