HELP I GOT MYSELF STUCK IN THE NUCLEAR REACTOR AGAIN
Joy and cheer, across the land, spanning far and wide. This sleepy town, laid to rest, polynucleotide.
In moments of extreme self-loathing, just remember that you brought this unto yourself
My love for you is like our donned apparel: gay
Life is an endless menagerie of misery and debauchery
Thanks a stack, thanks a heap
Why don’t you Gobi Desert somewhere else
A comedically large hat juxtaposed with an inhumanly small man
I don’t think I’m going to make it…the outlook is too hydrological…
My shoes are laced with C4
The antonym of fashion is pornography
DNUCE
Dominant and obsequious
Where’s your Erozone™? (erogenous zone)
Pluviophilia; I want to have sex with rain
Quantum Flubbing Event
The master becomes the mastee
FDA—not the Food and Drug Administration, you Fucking DumbAss
Libido Perpetuoso
