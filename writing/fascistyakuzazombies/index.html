		<p>I stood at the gate of the Grand Emperor’s Castle. I was the only one who could
		rescue him now. I took deep breaths, as Sensei had taught me, and resolutely
		stepped forward, across the property line.</p>
		<p>Without a beat, the Undead Fascist Yakuza Coalition came upon me. I unsheathed
		my poised katana and upended those bastards.</p>
		<p>A rotting samurai hollered a war cry; he emerged from a decorative bush with a
		piercing, murderous gaze of hatred. He screamed once more, but it was <em>cut</em>
		short—my blade slit his throat. <span style="font-family: cjkserif !important;">さようなら、やくざ！</span></p>
		<p>I traversed down the winding trail, towards the fortress’s entrance. The
		Coalition guerrillas—persistent, I can give them that—fruitlessly bombarded me.
		I performed my famous Knocker-Shocker—I put my right foot forcefully to their
		loins and the sword violently through their stomachs.</p>
		<p>Eventually, the castle engulfed my view north. The entrance, miniscule in
		comparison to the whole, was surrounded by a lavish overhang decorated with
		traditional artwork and text.</p>
		<p>A trail of corpses behind me and the blood on my armor dry, I had a moment to
		appreciate the beauty of the Grand Emperor’s abode. I stepped up to the wall,
		intrigued by the depiction of a nude woman. She sat cross-legged, treating her
		long black hair with a brush. A haiku was written beside her—it read:</p>
		<center>
			My father-in-law<br>
			He loved his children wholly<br>
			Now to my son Tom<br>
		</center>
		<p>I blinked, confused. Tom is an American name, and it also happens to be <em>my</em>
		name.</p>
		<p>Flummoxed, I absently stepped backwards. I bumped into someone—terrified, I
		whipped around.</p>
		<p>It was a woman—the one appearing, in the nude, on the entrance. She had a slight
		grin of benevolence on her attractive face.</p>
		<p>Behind her, a crowd was cheering. They assembled themselves as people arrived
		from the trail. My fear disintegrated: they were my fans!</p>
		<p>“Go! Go! Go! Go!” they yelled.</p>
		<p>My confidence reemerged; I spun around again and ran into the castle, determined
		to save the Grand Emperor from the devilish Coalition. I grasped my sword above
		my shoulders. My fierce passion for the art of the kill boiled within me.</p>
		<p>I entered the expansive foyer. I could still hear my ecstatic supporters.</p>
		<p>“Go! Go! Go! Go! <em>Go-ooo!</em>” they chanted.</p>
		<p>Unexpectedly, somebody snatched my left arm—damn yakuza! I swung out my sword,
		but I realized it was not my faithful katana. A Nintendo Switch stood at the
		neck of my mother.</p>
		<p>“Go!”</p>
		<p>I forgot to write a eulogy.</p>
