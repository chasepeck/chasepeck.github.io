    <p>“Place both palms on the object. Let the psychic current flow through
    you. Focus on deciphering the signal, and nothing else,” she said. My
    hands, spread like a butterfly, cradled a potted plant.</p>
    <p>“Close your eyes,” Ms. Renard instructed, and I followed.</p>
    <p>I said, “Dark.”</p>
    <p>“Shh.”</p>
    <p>I tried to focus on any schema that entered my mind, emptied myself
    of any other thoughts. For a few minutes, I sat in colorless void,
    waiting for the plant’s fortune. Ms. Renard was silent. I was beginning
    to lose my sense of time, when I envisioned:</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image5.jpg"></figure>
    <p>“Something!” I blurted.</p>
    <p>“Very good. What can you see?” replied Ms. Renard.</p>
    <p>“It’s blurry, but I think it says—sun.”</p>
    <p>“Very, very good. What do you make of it?”</p>
    <p>“Well, this plant—this plant has sun in its future. I guess it will
    grow big.”</p>
    <p>I opened my eyes. Ms. Renard was grinning at the other end of the
    wooden table. Around her house, ferns, philodendron, and fiddle-leaf
    figs grew healthily.</p>
    <p>“I’d say you’re right,” my tutor said.</p>
    <img id="sectionbreak" src="/assets/sectionbreaks/dinkus.png">
    <p>From there I visited Ms. Renard every Saturday evening. Abundant
    practice in-between. It was a hefty portion of my monthly paycheck, but
    she was an incomparable teacher.</p>
    <img id="sectionbreak" src="/assets/sectionbreaks/dinkus.png">
    <p>“Everything has a past embedded deep within. The key to the future is
    knowing the past. Go ahead, pick something,” Ms. Renard said. I got up
    from the dining table and meandered around her living room. I fell upon
    the couch, both hands planted on a cushion. It was stiff; it made a
    crunching sound. On my knees, I shut my eyes.</p>
    <p>I expanded my mind. It felt bloated, something exerting pressure on
    the inside of my cranium. Like a massage, a mix of pain and pleasure.
    Eventually it deflated, leaving behind the light of a word.</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image10.jpg"></figure>
    <p>“<em>Money,</em> I see,” I told Ms. Renard.</p>
    <p>Then I looked at her. She stared at me, looking vaguely surprised,
    her mouth ajar just enough for a nickel.</p>
    <p>“<em>Money?</em>” she said at last. “That’s peculiar.”</p>
    <p>I tried again. Still I received the same—<em>money.</em> I was about
    to lift the cushion, see what underneath was providing such a word, but
    Ms. Renard jumped hastily.</p>
    <p>“Excuse me, dear,” she interjected, “let me try.”</p>
    <p>She assumed the same position as I did, closing her eyes, crunching
    the couch in the same way. In ten seconds’time she told me, “No, I only
    see <em>buttocks.</em> But fret not. It’s undeniably difficult to
    correctly figure out what the current is trying to tell you.”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” I said.</p>
    <img id="sectionbreak" src="/assets/sectionbreaks/dinkus.png">
    <p>I was on my knees all night, in front of my dinky couch, in my
    poignantly bare apartment. I pushed my hands deep into the cushions. I
    squeezed my eyelids together. I flushed the external world down the
    drain, focusing solely on the meaning of the ΨI (psychic current)
    traversing through my body.</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image11.jpg"></figure>
    <p>I kept receiving <em>buttocks,</em> thankfully. Each time, I opened
    my eyes, took a lap around the room, did it again. Each time was
    gradually less blurry. I practiced until four in the morning. I sighed
    in relief, fell backwards onto the floor, fell asleep instantaneously.
    All the while the moon chuckled at me.</p>
    <img id="sectionbreak" src="/assets/sectionbreaks/dinkus.png">
    <p>Ms. Renard’s tuxedo cat glared at me from his tower, liquid emerald
    in his eyes, pupils thin as film. A scare.</p>
    <p>“Why don’t you apply yourself to Bouleau? I think you have the skill.
    But be patient. An animal has a complex past, rich and
    interweaving—especially Bouleau. All of those thick, sticky memories
    have to trickle through your being.” Ms. Renard patted her lap.
    “Pss-pss-pss, Bouleau!”</p>
    <p>The cat hesitantly rose, descended his castle—his unwavering glance
    stuck on me as he sauntered towards us. He sat delicately on the rug, by
    Ms. Renard’s leg. I leaned down to his level, and I placed my palms on
    his cheeks. He blinked, slowly, like he had received this treatment
    before.</p>
    <p>Dark.</p>
    <p>Bouleau’s ΨI seeped into my mind like water scales a paper towel.
    Mental images of his life pre-adoption jaywalked across my
    consciousness. A kitty’s life in the forest with his siblings, I
    imagined, and dump trucks and concrete mixers. And—while laying famished
    amidst wooden skeletons of houses—a woman with shaggy, red hair and
    deep, gray bags underneath her eyes reaches out her arms. I forced all
    of the energy in my body towards the signal. Take past memories,
    decipher the pattern, and determine the future.</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image12.jpg"></figure>
    <p>I opened my eyes.</p>
    <p>“…You’re grinning,” said Ms. Renard. I had not realized I was
    grinning.</p>
    <p>“Tuna.” And I chuckled. “There’s tuna in his future.”</p>
    <p>“Ah! He loves his tuna! Don’t you, sweetie-pie?”</p>
    <p>“Mrrow~” <em>(Indubitably.)</em></p>
    <img id="sectionbreak" src="/assets/sectionbreaks/dinkus.png">
    <p>Yes, I practiced clairvoyance every minute I had unoccupied. Late at
    night in the apartment, I would tell the fortunes of my window, my
    walls, my lamp. Sometime in the future the walls will be painted liquid
    emerald.</p>
    <p>Ms. Renard was teaching me connections with animals. I couldn’t
    afford a pet. I didn’t like Bouleau near me anymore. So I ventured into
    the alleys and grabbed rats by the neck. With most of them I saw:</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image7.jpg"></figure>
    <p>But with one saucy fellow I saw:</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image6.jpg"></figure>
    <p>I think he started to asphyxiate, and he bit my thumb. Sorry, I let
    him scurry off. I couldn’t afford a hospital visit. I used a
    Band-Aid.</p>
    <p><em>No pain, no gain!</em> I heard that on TV. I can’t get enough of
    petite, juicy aphorisms. I was in pain, but indeed I was gaining.
    Visions becoming clearer.</p>
    <img id="sectionbreak" src="/assets/sectionbreaks/dinkus.png">
    <p>“Try me,” she said.</p>
    <p>“You?”</p>
    <p>“On my temples. A whole year—you’re nearly a master.”</p>
    <p>I laid my hands on Ms. Renard’s temples. The first attempt on a
    <em>Homo sapiens.</em> I entered the darkness.</p>
    <p>For three hours—as I estimate, anyway—my head gradually warmed, like
    an active wire. The ΨI feeding into my brain developed overexposed
    photographs of Ms. Renard’s past. She appeared as a coagulation of
    plasma in the formation of the universe, perambulating around, having
    nice conversations with other coagulations of plasma. Her human emotions
    were too intricate to fit fully through the bandwidth of my palms, and I
    received the strands of cheese shoved through the grater.</p>
    <p>My head did not stop warming. Eventually it stung. It stung, when all
    of the light snapped into a grid. All of the data organized itself, and
    the future became clear:</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image3.jpg"></figure>
    <p><em>Scam!</em></p>
    <p>I sprung from my chair. Ms. Renard snorted awake.</p>
    <p>She breathed, half-conscious, “What… Where are you going?”</p>
    <p>I sprinted across the room, sliding the carpet along the floor,
    nearly falling, and burst through the front door. I ran, then walked,
    all the way from Ms. Renard’s house in the metropolitan suburbs to my
    apartment in the city. All the while the moon laughed uproariously.</p>
    <img id="sectionbreak" src="/assets/sectionbreaks/dinkus.png">
    <p>I wallowed in bed for a very protracted period of time. Nature called
    and I got up.</p>
    <p>Lights blinding in the bathroom. I wanted to become catatonic. No
    senses and no thoughts. So I closed my eyes.</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image1.jpg"></figure>
    <p>I stopped peeing.</p>
    <p>I left my apartment. In the hall, my neighbor was unlocking her door.
    I needed more practice. I tried to tell her fortune.</p>
    <p>“Get your hands off me! What is wrong with you?!” she yelled.</p>
    <p>I ran off, down the stairs. Dawn drew streaks of sunlight on the
    lobby floor. Ten people ate breakfast in the communal area. At each
    table I tried to garner ΨI. The most I got was:</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image2.jpg"></figure>
    <p>Ten times I was scolded for trying to practice my craft. I was near
    perfection, I thought. If <em>lonely</em> is in my future then so be it.
    Interpersonal relationships disintegrate like the uneducated mind. I am
    achieving nirvana.</p>
    <p>I ran out of the building. I tried many passersby. I tried everyone
    at the patio restaurant. Many foreheads were greasy. Anyway, all
    failures; not one considerate person around. Outside of the department
    store, a woman talked to someone. She was not looking at her baby. I put
    my hands on the infant’s head. They did not resist.</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image8.jpg"></figure>
    <p>Good job. Before anyone could oppress me, I blended with the crowd,
    heading towards the office district. I was burning hot, spent. I rubbed
    the sweat off of my eyelids with both palms.</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image9.jpg"></figure>
    <p><em>Diagnosis!</em></p>
    <p>I looked at my thumb. Since the saucy rat a few months ago, the scar
    had progressed through the rainbow. The little guy must have given me
    AIDS.</p>
    <p><em>Fate is a curious thing. </em>An applicable aphorism. Most people
    deal with fate on a need-to-know basis, but I—I had improved my skills
    enough that I could tell my own fate.</p>
    <p>I figured I should try to preserve myself. At the end of the district
    was the hospital. I avoided all eye contact until I checked in at the
    ER.</p>
    <p>I sat, lit by fluorescence. In my pocket, I had the wad of cash that
    I was going to give Ms. Renard—before I figured out she’d been
    exploiting me. I could use it to pay for any treatment.</p>
    <p>I wondered why her couch communicated <em>money</em> to me.</p>
    <p>Waiting, I came up with my own aphorism:</p>
    <p><em>In general, people do not like having their foreheads grasped by
    strangers—with the exception of babies, who have not yet had their
    compassion killed by society. You must practice clairvoyance
    persistently, until you have reached perfection; worrying about the
    thoughts of heartless normies is only a distraction. The past and future
    are both infinitely large, while the present is only a byte. The present
    is too fleeting to ignore its bookends. To care at all about current
    sensations and feelings is unhealthy gambling—all of it is gone in an
    instant! The only solution is to know the past and future so intimately
    that you practically live in them. Then all issues of the present
    vanish. You can live the rest of your life in blissful apathy. Do not
    trust Bouleau.</em></p>
    <p>Petite and juicy, I thought.</p>
    <p>I waited in the meager present for my future to arrive. It was a long
    time in the waiting room.</p>
    <p>I wanted to practice on the others around me, but I was exhausted.
    Unconsciously I bent over, sighing, putting my hands over my eyes.</p>
    <figure><img src="images/image4.jpg"></figure>
    <p>I started peeing again.</p>
