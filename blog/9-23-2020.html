        <p>woah! version four? really? it's been five months since the major redesign. also five months we've been stuck at home. i've never realized
            how much i hate walls until now. so pale, so boring, so beige. why do walls have to be so boring? make your wall not boring. make it unboring.
            do it! now! do it now! paint your wall with an eye-burning color! you see, i am a teen of uniqueness, if that is a word. betwixt thou and me,
            do something! not anything, but something. something that is not anything but it is something that isn't usually done. are you gettin' what i'm throwin'?
            as for me, i am doing multiple somethings. for starters, i'm making this blog post that you don't understand. for many millenia, i have done nothing.
            but now i am doing something! you will see that something soon. no, it's not <i>that</i> something. <i>that</i> something is going to take many somethings'
            worth of time. just shut up about the somethings! off you go! do your somethings! oh, damn. i forgot to talk about the new features.<br><br>

            v4 features:<br>
            - new repos page. sorry, it's kinda basic right now.<br>
            - better metadata. pages will look better in search engines.<br>
            - bug fixes. squash the bugs!<br>
            - cleaning up the code. it needed some dusting.<br>
            - new additions to multiple pages.<br>
            - alien tracking device that knows your every move.<br>
            - and of course, new subtitles!!!<br>
