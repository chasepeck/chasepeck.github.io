    <h3>Why I Am A Mentally Stable Person</h3>
    <p>This essay documents precisely <i>why</i> I am a mentally stable person. As you could tell, all of my writings on this page
    have been totally coherent. In no ways could these writings be considered as idiotic, moronic, tectonic, or stinky.
    I can promise you that every thought that I have ever had--like "maybe the Earth <i>is</i> flat", "I wonder how much my kidney is worth",
    "ÀÜÀÜ¬™¬¢ÀÜm√Üf√™≈Çmba√ü9¬™¬∂‚àû¬∂¬µ¬µ¬µÀö∆í¬¥√∏∆í‚àÜs", or "two million, four hundred and ninety-two thousand, two hundred and sixty-one"--has made sense.
    As you know, I am the world record holder of "most thoughts thought in a day." It is 59. What kind of person would I be if each and every one
    of those thoughts <i>didn't</i> make sense? I would be a coward, and a murderer, and a dictator. Would you really want me to be a murderer?
    No! You stupid idiot AKA moron! You would not want that. Pause for a moment as the Safety Dance plays in the background.
    Take a moment to think of some things. If any of those things do not make sense, you are a hypocrite! You will regret not making any sense.
    Look at any word on this page. (Book, fart, thing, m√∏√∏s√´, moon, etc) All of those words make sense! If you say otherwise, you are a cheater
    and a liar. Also, a murderer! Now we are even. We are both murderers. I mean, you are the only murderer. And I am going to stay away from your house,
    especially if it is late at night. I mean, I will stay away from you regardless. Good day! I hope I have proven to you why I am a mentally stable person.</p>
